# Provider Sync

Provider sync takes your skills and composed agents and writes them into the native config format for each AI coding assistant. This is the bridge between your portable `.agentis/` skills and the provider-specific files your tools actually read.

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Output Path | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude | `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Single file, skills under H2 headings | Used by Claude Code |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/{slug}.mdc` | One MDC file per skill | Cursor Rules format |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Single file, all skills concatenated | Copilot custom instructions |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/rules/{slug}.md` | One Markdown file per skill | Windsurf Rules |
| Cline | `.clinerules` | Single flat file | Cline system prompt |
| OpenAI | `.openai/instructions.md` | Single file, all skills concatenated | OpenAI custom instructions |

## Configuring Providers

Providers are configured per project in the Filament Admin panel (http://localhost:8000/admin). Edit a project and check the providers you want to enable.

Each provider is stored as a row in the `project_providers` table with the provider key (e.g., `claude`, `cursor`) and an enabled flag.

## Running a Sync

From the project detail page in the React SPA, click **Sync**. This:

1. Reads all skills for the project
2. Resolves [includes](./includes) and [template variables](./templates) for each skill
3. Composes all enabled [agents](./agent-compose)
4. Calls each enabled provider's sync driver
5. Writes the output files to the project directory

::: warning
Sync overwrites the provider config files completely. Any manual edits to files like `.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` will be lost. The `.agentis/` directory is the source of truth -- always edit there.

## What Gets Synced

The sync output includes:

- **Individual skills** -- Each skill's resolved body (with includes and template variables expanded)
- **Composed agents** -- Each enabled agent's composed output (base + custom + assigned skills)

Skills and agents are ordered by their sort order / name within each provider's output format.

## Provider-Specific Details

### Claude

All skills are written to a single `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file. Each skill becomes an H2 section:

```markdown
## Code Review Standards

[resolved body of code-review skill]

## Testing Strategy

[resolved body of testing-strategy skill]
```

### Cursor

Each skill gets its own `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/`. The file uses Cursor's MDC frontmatter format:

```markdown
---
description: Code Review Standards
---

[resolved body]
```

### GitHub Copilot

All skills are concatenated into `.github/copilot-instructions.md` separated by headings.

### Windsurf

Each skill gets its own `.md` file in `.windsurf/rules/`, similar to the Cursor format but without MDC-specific frontmatter.

### Cline

Everything is written to a single `.clinerules` file as plain text.

### OpenAI

All skills are concatenated into `.openai/instructions.md`, similar to the Copilot format.

## Preview Before Syncing

Use the [Diff Preview](./diff-preview) feature to see exactly what will change before writing files. Click **Preview Sync** instead of **Sync** to open the diff modal.
