# Creating Skills

Skills are the core unit in Agentis Studio. Each skill is a reusable AI prompt stored as a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter.

## The Skill Editor

Open any skill from the project detail page to launch the Skill Editor. The editor has three panels:

- **Left sidebar** -- Frontmatter form with all metadata fields
- **Center** -- Monaco code editor for the skill body (Markdown)
- **Right panel** -- Tabs for Test, Versions, and Lint

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Yes | Display name of the skill |
| `description` | string | No | Short summary of what the skill does |
| `model` | string | No | Target model (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-6`) |
| `max_tokens` | number | No | Max output tokens for test/playground |
| `tags` | string[] | No | Tags for categorization and filtering |
| `tools` | object[] | No | Tool/function definitions (JSON) |
| `includes` | string[] | No | Slugs of other skills to [include](./includes) |
| `template_variables` | object[] | No | [Template variable](./templates) definitions |

Fill in the fields in the sidebar form. The `name` field is the only required field -- everything else is optional.

### Writing the Body

The body is plain Markdown that becomes the system prompt or instruction content. Write it as you would any AI prompt:

```markdown
You are a senior TypeScript developer. When writing or reviewing code:

## Style Rules

- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use explicit return types on all public functions

## Error Handling

- Never swallow errors silently
- Use custom error classes for domain-specific failures
- Always include context in error messages

## Example

Given a function that fetches user data:

```typescript
// Good
export const fetchUser = async (id: string): Promise<User> => {
  const response = await api.get(`/users/${id}`);
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new UserNotFoundError(`User ${id} not found`);
  }
  return response.json();
};
```

Use Markdown headings, lists, code blocks, and emphasis to structure your prompt. The Monaco editor provides syntax highlighting for Markdown.

## Token Estimation

The editor displays a live token count in the frontmatter sidebar. The estimate updates as you type and uses a character-based approximation (roughly 1 token per 4 characters).

Token counts are color-coded against the model's context limit:

- **Green** -- Under 75% of context window
- **Yellow** -- 75-90% of context window
- **Red** -- Over 90% of context window

::: tip
If your skill is very long, consider splitting it into smaller skills and using the [includes system](./includes) to compose them.

## Saving

Press `Ctrl+S` (or `Cmd+S` on macOS) to save. Every save:

1. Updates the skill in the database
2. Writes the `.agentis/skills/{slug}.md` file to disk
3. Creates a new [version snapshot](./versions)
4. Optionally [auto-commits to git](./git-integration) if enabled

An unsaved changes indicator appears when you have modifications. The editor also warns you if you try to navigate away with unsaved changes.

## Duplicating a Skill

Click **Duplicate** in the action bar to clone a skill. The duplicate gets a new slug with a `-copy` suffix. You can duplicate within the same project or across projects.

## Deleting a Skill

Click **Delete** in the action bar. This removes the skill from the database and deletes the `.agentis/skills/{slug}.md` file from disk. Deletion is permanent -- there is no trash or soft delete.

::: warning
Deleting a skill also removes all its version history. If you might want the skill back later, consider exporting it as a [bundle](./bundles) first.

## Bulk Operations

From the project detail page, enter select mode to multi-select skills. The bulk action bar lets you:

- **Tag** -- Add or remove tags from selected skills
- **Assign** -- Assign selected skills to an agent
- **Move** -- Move selected skills to another project
- **Delete** -- Delete all selected skills

## AI-Assisted Generation

Click **Generate** in the action bar or on the project detail page to describe what you want in plain language. Claude generates a complete skill with frontmatter and body that you can review and edit before saving.
