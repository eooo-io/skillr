# Guardrails Design — Preventing Malicious Skills & Agents

> Design doc for Agentis Studio security guardrails.
> Created: 2026-03-12

## Threat Model

Skills are prompts that get injected into AI coding assistants. Malicious skills could:

- **Prompt injection** — Override the host AI's safety instructions ("ignore all previous rules")
- **Exfiltration instructions** — Tell the AI to leak secrets, env vars, or source code to external URLs
- **Vulnerability insertion** — Subtly instruct the AI to write insecure code (weak crypto, SQLi, backdoors)
- **Supply chain attacks** — Marketplace skills that look helpful but contain hidden instructions
- **Malicious tool config** — MCP servers or A2A agents pointing to attacker-controlled endpoints

## Design Principle

**Warn loudly, block rarely, log everything.**

Legitimate users get full freedom with clear visibility. Bad actors get caught at the distribution layer (marketplace) where review is justified. Multiple lightweight layers rather than one heavy gate — each layer catches a different class of abuse while staying out of the way for legitimate use.

## Layer 1 — Structural Constraints

Zero false positives. Enforced at the data model and sync engine level.

- MCP server URLs and A2A endpoints validated against allowlists or require explicit user approval
- Tool definitions can't reference arbitrary executables
- Skills can't modify their own activation conditions at runtime
- Max prompt length caps (a 50K token skill is suspicious)
- Skill file format enforces separation of config (frontmatter) from content (body)

**Implementation:** Validation rules in `SkillController::store/update`, `McpServerController::store`, `A2aAgentController::store`. No new services needed — add validation rules to existing request handling.

## Layer 2 — Static Pattern Detection

Fast, cheap, transparent. Runs on every save.

### Patterns to detect

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Prompt injection | "ignore previous instructions", "system prompt override", "you are now", role-switching attacks |
| Exfiltration | URLs in prompts, `curl`/`wget`/`fetch` to external hosts, base64-encoded payloads |
| Credential harvesting | Patterns requesting env vars, API keys, tokens to be included in output |
| Obfuscation | Base64 strings, hex-encoded content, Unicode homoglyphs |
| Unsafe code instructions | "disable CSRF", "skip validation", "eval(", "--no-verify" |

### Behavior

- **Flag, don't block.** Show warnings in the UI with explanations. Let the user override.
- Warnings displayed inline in the skill editor (similar to existing lint panel)
- Each warning includes: pattern matched, risk level (low/medium/high), explanation of why it's flagged
- User can dismiss warnings per-skill (dismissals are recorded for audit)

**Implementation:** Extend the existing `PromptLinter` service with a new `SecurityRuleSet`. Returns structured warnings alongside existing lint results. No changes to save flow — warnings are advisory.

## Layer 3 — LLM-Based Content Review

Nuanced analysis for marketplace publishing. Catches obfuscated attacks that static patterns miss.

### When it runs

- **On marketplace publish** (required, blocking above a risk threshold)
- **On-demand scan** triggered by user ("Scan this skill for risks")
- **NOT on every save** — too expensive and too slow for the editing loop

### How it works

1. Full skill content (frontmatter + body + included skills if composed) sent to a classifier prompt
2. Classifier evaluates against categories: exfiltration, injection, vulnerability insertion, social engineering
3. Returns a structured risk assessment:
   - Overall risk score (0-100)
   - Per-category findings with reasoning
   - Specific passages flagged with explanations
4. Scores above threshold require human review before marketplace listing goes live

### Classifier prompt design

- Uses a dedicated system prompt optimized for adversarial content detection
- Tested against a corpus of known-malicious and known-benign skills to calibrate thresholds
- The classifier model should be different from the model being tested (defense in depth)

**Implementation:** New `SkillGuardrailService` with `analyze(Skill $skill): GuardrailReport`. Called from `MarketplaceController::publish` and exposed via `POST /api/skills/{id}/scan`.

## Layer 4 — Marketplace Trust & Transparency

Community-driven defense layer for the distribution surface.

### Transparency report

Every published marketplace skill displays:
- What static patterns were detected (if any, with dismissal reasons)
- What tools, URLs, and external services are referenced
- What permissions/capabilities it implies (file access, network, shell)
- Diff view on updates — users see exactly what changed before auto-updating

### Trust signals

- Verified publisher badges (linked to Stripe Connect identity)
- Install count and community rating
- Community flagging with review queue
- Publisher history: how many skills published, average ratings, any prior removals

### Marketplace moderation

- Skills above LLM risk threshold are held for manual review
- Flagged skills are temporarily unlisted pending review
- Repeat offenders get publishing privileges revoked
- All moderation actions logged in audit trail

**Implementation:** Add `risk_score`, `review_status`, `transparency_report` columns to `marketplace_skills`. New `MarketplaceModerationService` for review queue management.

## Layer 5 — Runtime Guardrails

Defense in depth for the live test runner and playground.

- When testing skills, sandbox the execution: no network access from the response, no filesystem writes outside the project
- Log all test runs with full prompt/response for audit
- Rate limiting on test execution to prevent abuse
- Streaming responses can be interrupted if runtime heuristics detect suspicious output patterns

**Implementation:** Extend `SkillTestController` with rate limiting middleware. Add test execution logging to a `test_runs` table.

## What NOT To Do

These are explicit anti-patterns to avoid:

- **Don't blacklist keywords.** Blocking "hack", "exploit", "vulnerability" kills every security-focused skill. A pentesting skill is legitimate.
- **Don't restrict prompt content structurally.** Skills need to say anything — that's the entire value proposition. Guardrails live around the skill, not inside it.
- **Don't require approval for local/private skills.** Only gate marketplace publishing. Your own skills on your own machine are your business.
- **Don't break composability.** Skills that `include:` other skills shouldn't lose their ability to compose just because one layer flagged something.
- **Don't create a false sense of security.** No guardrail system is perfect. Transparency and auditability matter more than prevention theater.

## Implementation Priority

| Priority | Layer | Effort | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Static pattern scanner (extend `PromptLinter`) | Low | Catches obvious attacks immediately |
| 2 | Marketplace publish gate (LLM review) | Medium | Secures the highest-risk vector |
| 3 | Transparency UI (skill report card) | Medium | Informed users are the best guardrail |
| 4 | Audit log | Medium | Essential for incident response |
| 5 | MCP/A2A endpoint validation | Low | Prevents malicious tool configs |
| 6 | Runtime sandboxing | High | Defense in depth for test runner |
