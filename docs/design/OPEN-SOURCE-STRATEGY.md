# Open Source & Free Tier Strategy

> Design doc for Agentis Studio's open source / free tier positioning.
> Created: 2026-03-12

## Decision

**Closed-source product with a generous free tier for open source projects.**

Not open-core. Not fully open source. A unified codebase with a free plan gated on project license detection.

## Why Not Open-Core

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| Codebase fragmentation | Maintaining OSS + proprietary boundary is constant overhead |
| Feature gating complexity | Every feature decision becomes "is this free or paid?" at the code level |
| Community expectations | OSS communities expect governance, RFC processes, contributor docs — real cost |
| Marketplace risk | An open-core marketplace invites forks that strip out fees |
| Revenue dilution | Self-hosted OSS users never convert — they chose OSS to avoid paying |
| Speed | Solo/small team moves faster with one codebase, one build, one deploy target |

Open-core works for infrastructure (databases, observability) where enterprises need on-prem. Agentis Studio is a developer tool — cloud-first is natural.

## Why Free-for-Open-Source

### Strategic benefits

1. **Credibility without complexity** — Supporting OSS earns goodwill without maintaining a fork
2. **Proven playbook** — GitHub, JetBrains, GitKraken, Snyk, Sentry, Linear all do this
3. **Network effects** — OSS devs write about tools, recommend them in READMEs, create tutorials
4. **Pipeline to paid** — Devs use free tier on side projects, bring Agentis to their company
5. **Marketplace seeding** — OSS users create and share skills, building marketplace inventory
6. **Low cost to serve** — OSS projects are typically smaller, lower usage

### What the OSS community actually wants

They don't want to self-host your SaaS. They want:
- Free access for their non-commercial work
- Assurance you won't rug-pull the free tier
- Transparency about what's free vs paid
- A way to contribute back (marketplace skills, not core code)

## Plan Architecture

### Tier: Free (Open Source)

**Eligibility:** Project has an OSI-approved license detected in `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` at the repo root, OR the project is hosted on a public GitHub/GitLab repository.

| Feature | Limit |
|---|---|
| Projects | Up to 5 |
| Skills per project | Up to 25 |
| Provider sync | All 7 providers |
| Skill versions | Last 10 per skill |
| Marketplace | Browse + install free skills |
| Marketplace publishing | Yes (free skills only) |
| Test runner | 50 runs/day |
| Team members | 1 (solo) |
| MCP server configs | Up to 3 per project |
| A2A agent configs | Up to 3 per project |
| Agent Compose | Up to 3 workflows |
| CLI | Full access |
| Skill bundles | Import only (can't create) |

### Tier: Pro ($12/month)

For individual developers on private/commercial projects.

| Feature | Limit |
|---|---|
| Projects | Unlimited |
| Skills per project | Unlimited |
| Provider sync | All 7 providers |
| Skill versions | Unlimited history |
| Marketplace | Full access (free + paid skills) |
| Marketplace publishing | Yes (free + paid skills, 85/15 rev share) |
| Test runner | Unlimited (fair use) |
| Team members | 1 |
| MCP / A2A configs | Unlimited |
| Agent Compose | Unlimited workflows |
| CLI | Full access |
| Skill bundles | Create + share |
| Priority support | Email |

### Tier: Team ($29/seat/month)

For teams and organizations.

| Feature | Limit |
|---|---|
| Everything in Pro | Yes |
| Team members | Unlimited |
| Shared skill library | Cross-project, org-wide |
| Role-based access | Admin, Editor, Viewer |
| SSO / SAML | Yes |
| Audit log | Full history |
| Org-wide provider config | Centralized API keys & defaults |
| Usage analytics | Per-member, per-project |
| Invoice billing | Yes |

## OSS License Detection

### How it works

1. On project creation/scan, read `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, `LICENSE.txt`, or `COPYING` from project root
2. Match content against SPDX license list using simple header detection
3. Alternatively, check `license` field in `package.json`, `composer.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`
4. For GitHub-hosted projects, query the GitHub API license endpoint as a fallback
5. Cache the result on the `projects` table; re-check on each scan

### Supported OSI licenses (non-exhaustive)

MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, LGPL-2.1, LGPL-3.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, MPL-2.0, ISC, AGPL-3.0, Unlicense, CC0-1.0, Artistic-2.0, Zlib, BSL-1.0

### Edge cases

- **Dual-licensed projects**: If any license is OSI-approved, qualifies as free
- **No license file**: Does not qualify (public repo without a license is not OSS)
- **Custom/proprietary license**: Does not qualify
- **License changes**: Re-evaluated on each project scan; if license removed, grace period of 30 days before downgrade

## Anti-Abuse Measures

- Rate limit project creation on free tier (5 projects max, not 5 at a time)
- License file must be present in the actual project directory (not faked in a wrapper repo)
- Periodic re-validation of OSS status on active projects
- Free tier users who publish paid marketplace skills get flagged for review
- GitHub API cross-reference: if project claims OSS but repo is private, doesn't qualify

## Migration Path

Users can upgrade/downgrade freely:

- **Free → Pro**: Instant, all data preserved, limits lifted
- **Pro → Free**: Graceful — excess projects/skills become read-only (not deleted), user chooses which to keep active within free limits
- **Pro → Team**: Instant, invite team members
- **Team → Pro**: Team members lose access, data preserved under the owner

## What We Communicate

### Messaging to OSS community

> "Agentis Studio is free for open source. If your project has an OSI-approved license, you get full access to build, test, and sync AI skills — no credit card, no trial expiry. We believe the tools that shape AI-assisted development should be accessible to everyone building in the open."

### Messaging to commercial users

> "For teams and commercial projects, Agentis Studio Pro gives you unlimited skills, full version history, and marketplace access starting at $12/month."

### What we DON'T say

- "Open source" when referring to Agentis Studio itself (it's not)
- "Free forever" (free tier terms can evolve, but OSS commitment is durable)
- "Community edition" (implies an open-core split we don't have)

## Comparison to Alternatives

| Approach | Example | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Free-for-OSS** (ours) | GitHub, JetBrains, Sentry | Simple, proven, earns goodwill | No community code contributions |
| Open-core | GitLab, Supabase | Community contributions, self-host option | Codebase split, governance overhead |
| Fully open source | VS Code, Zed | Maximum trust and adoption | Hard to monetize, forks compete |
| Freemium (no OSS angle) | Most SaaS | Simple business model | No developer community credibility |
| Source-available | Elastic, HashiCorp | Transparency without full OSS | Community backlash, license confusion |

## Implementation Notes

### Database changes

```sql
-- Add to projects table
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN detected_license VARCHAR(50) NULL;
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN is_oss BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN license_checked_at TIMESTAMP NULL;

-- Add to organizations/users (depending on auth model)
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN plan ENUM('free', 'pro', 'team') DEFAULT 'free';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN plan_expires_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
```

### Service changes

- New `LicenseDetectionService` — reads license files, matches against SPDX list
- Extend `ProjectScanJob` to run license detection on each scan
- New `PlanEnforcementMiddleware` — checks limits on API endpoints
- Extend Stripe integration to manage Pro/Team subscriptions

### UI changes

- Plan badge in Filament sidebar and React SPA header
- Upgrade prompts when hitting limits (non-blocking, informational)
- Project settings show detected license and OSS status
- Billing page in Filament settings

## Revenue Projections (Conservative)

Assumes marketplace + subscriptions as dual revenue streams:

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Free (OSS) users | 2,000 | 8,000 |
| Pro subscribers | 200 | 1,000 |
| Team seats | 50 | 300 |
| Pro MRR | $2,400 | $12,000 |
| Team MRR | $1,450 | $8,700 |
| Marketplace MRR | $500 | $5,000 |
| **Total MRR** | **$4,350** | **$25,700** |

The free OSS tier is a marketing channel. Its ROI is measured in awareness, marketplace content, and conversion to Pro — not direct revenue.
