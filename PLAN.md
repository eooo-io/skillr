# Agentis Studio — Implementation Plan

> This file tracks implementation progress across sessions.
> Refer to `CLAUDE.md` for architecture details.

---

## Roadmap Overview

Agentis Studio is evolving from a skill/config sync tool into a full agent configuration, orchestration, and runtime platform. The roadmap has three phases:

```
Phase A — Agent Designer
  Design agents as full loop definitions (Goal → Perceive → Reason → Act → Observe).
  Export to Claude Agent SDK, LangGraph, CrewAI, and generic JSON.

Phase B — Orchestration
  Multi-agent workflows as DAGs. Visual workflow builder. Human-in-the-loop checkpoints.
  Delegation chains, handoff conditions, shared context.

Phase C — Design + Runtime
  Lightweight agent runtime inside Agentis. Execute agent loops with real tool calls.
  Playground evolves into execution environment. Memory persistence. Traces & cost tracking.
```

The existing Component Layer (skills, provider sync, MCP, A2A) remains the foundation. Each phase builds on the previous.

## Architecture: The Agent Loop

```
Goal
  │
  ▼
Perceive (input + memory retrieval)
  │
  ▼
Reason (model + planning loop)
  │
  ▼
Act (tool call or output)
  │
  ▼
Observe (result fed back into context)
  │
  └──► Repeat until goal met or termination condition hit
```

### Three Layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Orchestration Layer  (Phase B)          │
│  Workflows, DAGs, delegation chains,     │
│  human-in-the-loop checkpoints           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Agent Layer  (Phase A)                  │
│  Goal, Perceive, Reason, Act, Observe    │
│  Each agent is a complete loop           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Component Layer  (Phases 1–26, done)    │
│  Skills, Tools (MCP/A2A), Provider Sync, │
│  Memory (context sources), Schemas       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Current Status

**Phases 1–26 COMPLETE.** Component Layer fully built.
**Phase A in progress** — Agent Designer.

---

## Phase A: Agent Designer

### A.1 — Agent Data Model Expansion

| Issue | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| #83 | Add agent loop columns to agents table migration | |
| #84 | Add agent_mcp_server and agent_a2a_agent pivot tables | |
| #85 | Update Agent model with casts, relationships, fillable | |
| #86 | Update AgentSeeder with loop field defaults | |
| #87 | Expand project_agent pivot with override columns | |

**Agent Definition Structure:**
```
AgentDefinition
├── identity        (name, slug, role, icon, model, persona_prompt)
├── goal            (objective_template, success_criteria, max_iterations, timeout)
├── perception      (input_schema, memory_sources, context_strategy)
├── reasoning       (planning_mode, skills, temperature, system_prompt)
├── actions         (tools: MCP servers + A2A agents + custom tools)
├── observation     (eval_criteria, output_schema, loop_condition)
└── orchestration   (parent_agent_id, delegation_rules, can_delegate)
```

### A.2 — Agent Designer API

| Issue | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| #88 | Create AgentResource API resource | |
| #89 | Expand AgentController with full CRUD | |
| #90 | Agent tool binding endpoints (MCP + A2A) | |
| #91 | Agent export as JSON/YAML | |

**New endpoints:**
```
POST   /api/agents                                    # create
GET    /api/agents/{agent}                             # show
PUT    /api/agents/{agent}                             # update
DELETE /api/agents/{agent}                             # delete
POST   /api/agents/{agent}/duplicate                   # duplicate
GET    /api/agents/{agent}/export?format=json|yaml     # export
PUT    /api/projects/{p}/agents/{a}/mcp-servers        # bind MCP
PUT    /api/projects/{p}/agents/{a}/a2a-agents         # bind A2A
```

### A.3 — Agent Builder UI

| Issue | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| #92 | Agent list view with create/edit/delete | |
| #93 | Agent Builder form with loop sections | |
| #94 | Update API client with agent endpoints | |
| #95 | Agent Builder page routing | |

**Builder sections:** Identity, Goal, Perception, Reasoning, Actions, Observation, Orchestration — each collapsible, with Monaco editors for JSON/prompt fields.

### A.4 — Agent Compose v2

| Issue | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| #96 | Structured compose output format | |
| #97 | Structured compose API endpoint | |
| #98 | Update provider drivers for structured agents | |
| #99 | Generic JSON agent definition export format | |

**Key change:** `composeStructured()` returns system_prompt, model, tools (MCP/A2A/custom), skills, loop config, delegation config — not just concatenated text.

### A.5 — Agent Visualization Update

| Issue | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| #100 | Expand graph endpoint with agent loop data | |
| #101 | React Flow agent loop visualization | |
| #102 | Agent loop detail panel in visualization | |

### A.6 — Testing & Migration

| Issue | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| #103 | Pest tests for expanded Agent model | |
| #104 | Pest tests for AgentComposeService v2 | |
| #105 | API endpoint tests for agent CRUD | |
| #106 | Data migration for existing agents | |
| #107 | Update bundle export/import for expanded agents | |

### Implementation Sequence

```
A.1 (data model) ──► A.2 + A.4 in parallel (API + compose) ──► A.3 (UI) ──► A.5 (viz) ──► A.6 (tests throughout)
```

---

## Phase B: Orchestration (planned)

Multi-agent workflow designer with visual DAG builder.

- **Workflow entity:** name, trigger, entry_agent, steps (DAG), checkpoints, termination
- **Visual builder:** React Flow as actual flow designer (not just visualization)
- **Delegation chains:** agents hand off to sub-agents based on conditions
- **Human-in-the-loop:** checkpoint gates requiring approval before proceeding
- **Shared context:** agents in a workflow share a context bus
- **Export:** workflow definitions as LangGraph YAML, CrewAI configs, generic JSON

---

## Phase C: Design + Runtime (planned)

Lightweight agent runtime inside Agentis Studio.

- **Execution engine:** run agent loops with real LLM calls and tool execution
- **Playground evolution:** from chat tester to full agent execution environment
- **Real tool calls:** MCP server invocation, A2A agent delegation
- **Memory persistence:** agent state across loop iterations and sessions
- **Observation UI:** live view of perceive → reason → act → observe cycle
- **Execution logs:** traces, token costs, timing, error handling
- **Sandboxing:** tool execution in isolated environments
- **Cost controls:** budget limits, approval gates for expensive operations

## Tech Decisions

- Anthropic SDK: `mozex/anthropic-laravel`
- DB_HOST: `127.0.0.1` in .env (local), `mariadb` in .env.example (Docker)
- FULLTEXT index conditionally skips on SQLite for tests
- Remote uses HTTPS
- Session-based auth (`auth:web`) on API routes
- React Flow (`@xyflow/react`) for visualization
- Default seeded user: `admin@admin.com` / `password`

## Commands

```bash
# Local dev
composer dev                    # server + queue + pail + vite

# Docker
make up && make migrate         # start + seed

# Tests
composer test                   # or: make test (Docker)
cd ui && npx tsc --noEmit      # type-check SPA
```
